            Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and
            businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal),
            SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a
            multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company,
            Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. He has an estimated
            net-worth of around 59.2 billion dollars and is listed as the 16th
            richest person in the world according to Forbes. His ultimate goal
            is to make life multiplanetary and help humanity explore beyond
            Earth.
